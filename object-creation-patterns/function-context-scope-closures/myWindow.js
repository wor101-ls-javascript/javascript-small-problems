// const name = 'Naveed';
// const greeting = 'Hello';

const greeter = {
  message: (() => {
    const name = 'Naveed';
    const greeting = 'Hello';
    return `${greeting} ${name}!`
  })(),

  sayGreetings() {
    console.log(this.message);
  }
};


// Note that the message property uses the result of interpolation as its value. 
// As a result, we have two global variables: name, and greeting that pollute the global scope. 
// As we already know, we should limit the use of global variables as much as we can. 
// Here we can avoid using the global variables by simply setting the message property to the value "Hello Naveed!". 
// But let's pretend that we must use variables and interpolation to accomplish this. 
// Can you think of a way to refactor this code so we don't have any other variables in the global scope besides greeter?
