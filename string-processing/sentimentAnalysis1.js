**Problem**
Sentiment analysis, sometimes known as opinion mining, attempts to ascertain subjective information from a text and convert it to something concrete. 
For example, by using lists of positive and negative words, we can analyze the words in some text to determine whether the mood is positive, negative, or neutral.

Sentiment analysis adds a dimension to content that is mostly text based. Its main task is to classify the polarity of the text. 
In this practice problem, we will build a tool that determines the mood of some text. Note that we will take a simplistic approach. 
We don't recommend this approach for live sentiment analysis.

There are many ways to implement sentiment analysis. Here, we will use two arrays of words. 
One array contains words that connote a "positive" sentiment, while the other contains words that connote a "negative" sentiment. 
Given the counts of positive and negative words in our text, 
we can compute a sentiment score as the difference between the two counts, "positive word count - negative word count." 
The sentiment of the text is positive if the difference is positive, negative if the difference is negative, 
and neutral if the difference is 0 (the word counts are equal).

Implement a function that takes some text as an argument and logs some information about whether the text has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Here's an excerpt of some text taken from a Wikipedia article that compares different versions of "To be, or not to be".

/*
Algorithm:
1. create postiveTotal and negativeTotal variables that are arrays
2. iterate over positiveWords
  - use match with regex /word/g to return array of all matches
  - save array as postiveTotal
3. iterate over negativeWords
  - use match with regex /word/g to return array of all matches
  - save array as negativetotal
4. etermine finalsentiment based on difference between length of two arrays
4. Create output strings
