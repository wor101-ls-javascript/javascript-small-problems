// 1. The Math methods that deal with angle measurements all expect and return values in radians instead of degrees. 
//    Mathematically, radians are easier to work with, so nearly all languages use radians for circle and arc calculations. 
//    To read more about radians, check out this article. 
//    Use the Math.PI property to create a function that converts radians to degrees.

function radiansToDegrees(radians) {
  return radians * 180 / Math.PI;
}

console.log(radiansToDegrees(1));

// 2. To convert a positive integer to a negative integer, you can just place a minus sign in front of the variable that contains the integer. 
//    However, if you don't know whether the original value is negative you may inadvertently convert your variable to the wrong value. 
//    You can use the Math.abs method to simplify matters by forcing a value positive. 
//    For this problem, create a variable with a value of -180, then use Math.abs to log the positive value of the variable.

let myVariable = -180;
console.log(Math.abs(myVariable));

// 3. You can calculate the square of a number by multiplying the number by itself. 
//    Calculating the square root takes more work. Fortunately, the Math.sqrt method makes this easier than it would otherwise be. 
//    Use this method to find the square root of 16777216.

console.log(Math.sqrt(16777216));

// 4. Suppose, instead, that we want to calculate the 6th power of a number. 
//    We could multiply a number by itself six times with a function. 
//    However, it is easier to just use Math.pow. Math.pow takes two arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the result. 
//    Use Math.pow to compute and log the value of 16 to the 6th power
console.log(Math.pow(16, 6));

// 5. Rounding numbers up or down in JavaScript is easy, but there are three methods that perform different types of rounding. 
//    Math.round takes any decimal value and rounds it to the nearest integer. 
//    If the fractional part of the number is less than 0.5, Math.round rounds the value downwards; otherwise, it rounds the value upwards. 
//    Note: if the fractional part is exactly 0.5, Math.round rounds upwards. Math.floor rounds any number downward to the next lower integer. 
//    Math.ceil rounds any number upward to the next higher integer.

//    Use the appropriate method on each of these variables to return a value of 50. Make sure you use each method once.

let a = 50.72;
let b = 49.2;
let c = 49.86;

console.log(Math.floor(a));
console.log(Math.ceil(b));
console.log(Math.round(c));

// 6. Math.random returns a random floating-point number between 0 and 1, excluding the exact value of 1. 
//    This isn't helpful on its own, since you usually want a random integer between two other integer values. 
//    Create a function that takes two arguments, a minimum and a maximum value, and returns a random integer between those numbers (including both of the numbers). 
//    Your solution should handle the scenario that the user inadvertently swaps the positions of the min and max values or the scenario that the min and max values are equal. 
//    You may assume that the user always provides the min and max values.

function randomInt(min, max) {
if (min > max)  {
  [min, max] = [max, min];
}

  let rand;

let diff = max - min + 1;
return Math.floor(Math.random() * diff) + min;


}

console.log('');
console.log(randomInt(12,8));
console.log(randomInt(5, 5));
console.log(randomInt(9, 42));
console.log(randomInt(1,2));
