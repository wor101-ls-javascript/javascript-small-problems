**Problem**
Madlibs is a simple game where you create a story template with "blanks" for words. 
You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple madlib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective, and injects them into a story that you create.

**Examples / Test Cases**
Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly

// console output
Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
